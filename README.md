This is a test for education.

Hello, if you're reading this, it's just a file created for class.
I'm a student at Fitchburg State University (Aka FSU), and we're doing 3D animations.

Our Professor wanted us to download Github and sync it to Unity, so I just leaving this note here in case someone comes across this
which is highly unlikely lol
